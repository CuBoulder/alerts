description: 'Required, but defaults to Medium priority.  This field is used by the front page to determine the sort order of active incidents and therefore will really only be relevant when there are multiple active incidents at the same time.  Should that occur, you may use these settings to determine which active incident is displayed first by setting as High priority; last as low priority; and everything else in the middle as a Medium priority.
